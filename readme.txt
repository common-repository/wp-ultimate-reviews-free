== Description ==

WP Ultimate Reviews FREE lets you create testimonials and reviews with ratings. 
WP Ultimate Reviews Pro uses very simple shortcodes to generate your list of reviews, an average rating and a submission form.

Administrators can edit the content and name of a review, and all submitted reviews must be moderated before they are visible.
Administrators can also add new reviews manually - choose the page or product the review is aimed at, add a name, email (optional), star rating (out of 5) and write the review.

You can edit the design of the reviews and submission form using the template pages or make minor amends using your theme's own CSS file.

The FREE version excludes Schemas (microdata) and are therefore not compatible with Google Reviews.
The FREE version also excludes the ability to target your reviews to one specific page or product.

The PRO version provides Schemas for Products and Brands, and allows you to create multiple review types, for the entire website, one specific web page and/or a specific product.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I edit the design =

If you just want to change the colours, fonts, padding etc you can use your theme's own style.css file to override the styles used in the plugin.
If you want to edit the design even more navigate to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-testimonials-and-reviews/templates/` directory. Copy this folder and paste it in to your theme's folder. Now rename your newly pasted folder "wpurf". You are now able to edit all the files within the 'wpurf' folder. Please take care not to remove or rename div elements with ID and Name tags as these may be required for the plugin to work correctly.
